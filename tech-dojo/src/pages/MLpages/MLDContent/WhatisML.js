      <h1>What is Machine Learning? (Advanced Guide)</h1>
      <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) involves developing complex mathematical models that allow computers to generalize from experience. Advanced ML techniques are used in deep learning, generative models, and large-scale applications.
      </p>

      <h2>Advanced ML Techniques</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Using multi-layered neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).</li>
        <li><strong>Generative Models:</strong> GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models for AI-generated content.</li>
        <li><strong>Bayesian Methods:</strong> Probabilistic approaches to ML and uncertainty estimation.</li>
        <li><strong>Graph Neural Networks:</strong> ML on graph-structured data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges in ML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Interpretability & Explainability of AI decisions</li>
        <li>Bias & Ethical considerations in ML models</li>
        <li>Scalability of ML systems for real-world applications</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Autonomous AI Agents & Large Language Models (LLMs)</li>
        <li>Financial Market Prediction with ML & Reinforcement Learning</li>
