      <h1>What is Machine Learning? (Beginner Guide)</h1>
      <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
      </p>

      <h2>How Does ML Work?</h2>
      <p>
        At its core, ML works by training models on large amounts of data, allowing them to recognize patterns and make predictions.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of ML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Learning from labeled data.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Finding patterns in unlabeled data.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Learning through rewards and punishments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples of ML in Daily Life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Spam filters in emails</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube, Amazon)</li>
        <li>Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)</li>
      </ul>
